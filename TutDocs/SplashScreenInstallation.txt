App.tsx

1. Ensure Your Project is Using AndroidX
First, make sure your project is set to use AndroidX:

Open android/gradle.properties and add the following lines if they are not already present:

android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true

This ensures that all dependencies are migrated to AndroidX.

3. Clean and Rebuild the Project
Once you've made the changes, clean and rebuild your project to ensure that there are no leftover cached files causing the issue.

Run the following commands from your project root directory:

>cd android
>gradlew clean

Then, try running the app again with:

>npx react-native run-android
