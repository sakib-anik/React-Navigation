Explain:
import { takeEvery } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { USER_LIST } from "./constants";
function* userList(){
    console.warn('Saga Function Called');
}
function* SagaData(){
    yield takeEvery(USER_LIST,userList);
}

export default SagaData;

This code is using Redux-Saga, a middleware library for managing side effects (like asynchronous operations) in Redux applications.

Breakdown:
Import Statement:

javascript
Copy code
import { takeEvery } from "redux-saga/effects";
takeEvery: A Redux-Saga effect that listens for every dispatched action of a specified type and runs a saga (worker function) in response. It handles asynchronous actions in parallel.
Constant:

javascript
Copy code
import { USER_LIST } from "./constants";
USER_LIST: This is an action type (likely defined in the ./constants file). This constant represents the action that triggers the saga when dispatched.
Saga Worker Function (userList):

javascript
Copy code
function* userList() {
    console.warn('Saga Function Called');
}
function* userList(): This is a generator function (denoted by the * symbol). In Redux-Saga, generator functions yield effects, which are interpreted by the saga middleware.
Inside this function, console.warn('Saga Function Called') is simply logging a message to the console whenever this saga is triggered.
Saga Watcher Function (SagaData):

javascript
Copy code
function* SagaData() {
    yield takeEvery(USER_LIST, userList);
}
function* SagaData(): This is another generator function that serves as the watcher saga. Its job is to listen for specific action types.
yield takeEvery(USER_LIST, userList): This tells the saga middleware to run the userList worker saga every time an action of type USER_LIST is dispatched. It does this by yielding the takeEvery effect.
Exporting Saga:

javascript
Copy code
export default SagaData;
This line exports the SagaData function as the default export, so it can be imported and used in other parts of the application (likely in the Redux store configuration).
Flow:
An action of type USER_LIST is dispatched.
The SagaData function (watcher saga) listens for this action.
When it detects an action of type USER_LIST, it runs the userList function.
The userList function logs a message to the console ('Saga Function Called').
Summary:
Watcher Saga (SagaData): Listens for USER_LIST actions.
Worker Saga (userList): Runs when a USER_LIST action is dispatched.
Effect (takeEvery): Ensures that for every USER_LIST action, the userList saga is executed.
