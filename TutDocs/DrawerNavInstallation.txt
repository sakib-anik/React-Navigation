The error you're encountering (TypeError: global.__reanimatedWorkletInit is not a function) is related to an issue with react-native-reanimated and how it's interacting with react-navigation's Drawer Navigator and Hermes.

Here are steps to resolve this issue:

1. Ensure Proper Installation of react-native-reanimated
Run the following command to ensure you have the latest version:

bash
Copy code
npm install react-native-reanimated@latest
Then, add this configuration to your babel.config.js:

javascript
Copy code
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
  plugins: [
    'react-native-reanimated/plugin',  // Add this line for Reanimated
  ],
};
2. Ensure Correct Installation of Required Dependencies
If you haven't already, install these required dependencies for Drawer Navigation and Gesture Handling:

bash
Copy code
npm install @react-navigation/drawer
npm install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-safe-area-context
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
Then, link the native dependencies and reset Metroâ€™s cache:

bash
Copy code
npx react-native link
npx react-native start --reset-cache
3. Wrap Your App with GestureHandlerRootView
Make sure your app is properly wrapped with GestureHandlerRootView from react-native-gesture-handler. This is necessary for Drawer Navigation to work properly.

Modify your App.js:

javascript
Copy code
import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
import React from 'react';
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createDrawerNavigator } from '@react-navigation/drawer';
import ProductWrapper from './components/ProductWrapper';

const Drawer = createDrawerNavigator();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <NavigationContainer>
        <Drawer.Navigator initialRouteName="Home">
          <Drawer.Screen name="Home" component={ProductWrapper} />
        </Drawer.Navigator>
      </NavigationContainer>
    </GestureHandlerRootView>
  );
}
4. Rebuild the Project
After making these changes, clear the build and run the project again:

bash
Copy code
npx react-native-clean-project
npx react-native run-android
5. Double Check Hermes Configuration (Optional)
Sometimes, compatibility with Hermes can cause issues with react-native-reanimated. If the issue persists, you can try disabling Hermes in your android/app/build.gradle by setting enableHermes: false, but that should be your last resort.

Following these steps should resolve the issue related to react-native-reanimated and Drawer Navigation. Let me know if you encounter further problems!
